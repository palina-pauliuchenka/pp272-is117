Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by a website to record and track information about your interactions with the site. When you visit a website, it may place a cookie in your browser to remember your preferences, such as language settings or login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them on future visits. These cookies help provide a smoother and more personalized browsing experience by tailoring content to your needs and saving your preferences for later.

However, cookies can also be used for more complex tracking purposes. Websites often use cookies to collect information about your behavior, such as the pages you visit, the time spent on the site, and the links you click. This data is valuable for analytics, helping website owners understand user engagement and improve their services. Additionally, third-party cookies, which are set by domains other than the one you’re visiting, can track your activity across multiple websites. This allows advertisers to build a profile of your interests and serve targeted ads, raising privacy concerns for users who may not be fully aware of the extent of this tracking.

Furthermore, third-party cookies can contribute to a lack of transparency about who is collecting your data and for what purpose. That is why now all the websites are required to ask permission to collect cookies from your browsing on their website.
